 16 |     var b: ~&Bar = &a
    |         ^
    |         mutable object 'b' already references the same object
    |
 17 |     var c: ~&Bar = &a
    |         ^
    |         which you are trying to reference using the mutable object 'c'

    Hint:
    - Consider remove the mutability of one of them or both.
