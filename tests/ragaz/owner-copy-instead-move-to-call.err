 17 |     move(a[1])  # This needs be copied instead of moved as list elements can't be moved
    |           ^
    |           value cannot be moved here but only copied or referenced

    Hint:
    - If you don't intend copy it, consider reference the value using '&' operator. Otherwise, implement a magic method '__copy__' in 'Bar'.
